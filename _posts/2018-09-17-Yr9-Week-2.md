    <td>Today I learnt how to make a word turn into code using a formula . The formula works so that it changes the letter it for example A5 and it changes whatever letter is in B5. I did not know this before and I feel it could help me sometime in my life.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will go to coding club to give me more time to do the task and see what I did wrong and next lesson I will ask the teacher for help if I get stuck because this lesson I tried doing it by myself and asking people around me. </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change how I get help if I get stuck because other people around me might also be stuck but if I go to the teacher after I have tried myself and hopefully then he will help me and I can move onto the next thing.</td>
