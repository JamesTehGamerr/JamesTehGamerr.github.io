    <td>Today I found out what was going to happen in Yr9 IT and how we are going to achieve it. My IT teacher this year is actually a music teacher so I hope that he will be as good at teaching IT as the proper IT teachers. Hopefully he can also help me when I get stuck and I don't have to come back at lunch times to see an actual IT teacher.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Nothing really limited my learning because we didn’t learn anything really because we only discussed what we were going to do in Yr9. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I can’t change anything for next time because we didn’t do any IT this lesson so I can only say what I will change for next time once I’ve done some IT.</td>
